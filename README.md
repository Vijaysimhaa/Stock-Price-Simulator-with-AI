## **Installation Instructions** üõ†Ô∏è
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-simulator-ai.git

2. Install the required R libraries:
   ```bash
   install.packages(c("shiny", "plotly", "dplyr", "forecast", "caret"))

3. Run the application in RStudio:
   ```bash
   shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

### **Simulating Stock Prices**
- Enter a stock symbol (e.g., `AAPL`, `TSLA`, `GOOG`).
- Choose a time range to visualize the stock price over.
- The app will display real-time prices and AI-generated predictions.

### **AI Predictions**
- The app uses historical stock data to **predict** future stock prices.
- Make more **informed decisions** by analyzing predicted movements.

### **Managing Your Portfolio**
- Simulate buying and selling of stocks.
- Track your portfolio‚Äôs **value** and **profit/loss**.

## **AI Predictions** üîÆ
The AI in this project predicts **future stock prices** using powerful machine learning models. By analyzing **historical data**, the model provides users with predictions for short-term price movements, helping you to make informed investment decisions.

## **Data Sources** üìä

- **Real-Time Stock Data**: The app uses **Alpha Vantage** or **Yahoo Finance APIs** to fetch real-time stock prices.
- **Historical Data**: Historical stock prices are used to train machine learning models, which generate the AI predictions.
